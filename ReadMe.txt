Generates a basic brick or hardwood floor (contiguous rectangles) texture as SVG code.

Because the initial process for building a brick or hardwood floor texture is otherwise long and boring.

How to use:

Dimensions
1. Choose texture width and height
2. Choose width and height of rectangles. Height can be fixed or random. Enter a min and max value for random height.

Item Details
1. checking ‘brick pattern’ alternates column position so adjacent rectangles aren’t aligned
2. ‘Item spacing’ adds space between rectangles
3. Colors listed in the ‘Item Color List’ will be applied randomly. Colors must be separated by a comma.
4. Clicking ‘Generate Texture’ will output the SVG code along with a preview of your texture.

Click ‘generate texture,’ copy the code, paste it into a text editor, save it as an SVG and open it in Illustrator or whatever.
